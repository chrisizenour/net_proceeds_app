# Net Proceeds Form

This application was built to allow real estate agents to populate a form, which will return an Estimated Total Net Proceeds value.

This application will then produce an Excel file that the real estate agent can save locally, print to PDF, or print to hard-copy.

# Scripts

There are two main python scripts
- net_proceeds_app.py
- to_excel.py

The net_proceeds_app.py script is what created the Streamlit application

The to_excel.py script is the code that creates an MS Excel file that can be downloaded upon use of the application
